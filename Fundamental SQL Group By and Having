# Penggunaan MAX, MIN dan AVG dalam Having 

# Penggunaan Fungsi MAX pada Having 🚀
SELECT product_id, 
MAX(total_price) AS total 
FROM invoice GROUP BY product_id;
SELECT product_id, 
MAX(total_price) AS total 
FROM invoice 
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING MAX(total_price) > 1000000;
SELECT product_id,
MAX(pinalty) AS total 
FROM invoice 
GROUP BY product_id 
HAVING MAX(pinalty) > 30000; 


# Penggunaan Fungsi MIN pada Having 🚀
SELECT product_id, 
MIN(total_price) AS total 
FROM invoice 
GROUP BY product_id;
SELECT product_id, 
MIN(total_price) AS total 
FROM invoice 
GROUP BY product_id 
HAVING MIN(total_price) < 500000;
SELECT product_id,
MIN(pinalty) AS total 
FROM invoice 
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING MIN(pinalty) < 50000;


# Penggunaan Fungsi AVG di Having 🚀
SELECT product_id, 
AVG(total_price) AS total 
FROM invoice
GROUP BY product_id;
SELECT product_id, 
AVG(total_price) AS total 
FROM invoice 
GROUP BY product_id 
HAVING AVG(total_price) > 100000;
SELECT product_id, 
AVG(pinalty) AS total 
FROM invoice
